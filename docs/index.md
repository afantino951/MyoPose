## Abstract

Fine grained finger position tracking has many applications in healthcare,
extended reality (XR), and sports science. MyoPose uses hobby electronics to
read the muscle activation signals of the muscles in the forearm with surface
electromyograpgy (sEMG) and predict the angle of the joints of the fingers using
novel machine learning architectures. MyoPose includes two models: one based on
an autoencoder, commonly used for vision tasks, and Myo-BERT, a model based on
LIMU-BERT, a transformer-based models intended for use with inertial measurment
unit (IMU) data. MyoPose and Myo-BERT are within $$7.5^\circ$$ median accuracy
other solutions with consumer grade hardware with a smaller amount of training
data and sample window size.
