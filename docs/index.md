## Abstract

<!--**Provide a brief overview of the project objectives, approach, and
results.**-->

Fine grained finger position tracking has many applications in healthcare,
extended reality (XR), and sports science. MyoPose uses hobby electronics to
read the sEMG signals of the muscles in the forearm and process them into
finger angles using novel machine learning architectures. **TODO: Results**
